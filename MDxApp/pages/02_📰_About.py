    ### **Brief description of the web app**
    This app is designed to assist medical doctors and provide patients with a 
    fast diagnostic supported by the ChatGPT AI model of [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) based on relevant information such as age, 
    gender, pregnancy state, environmental and historical context, symptoms, observations, and test results conducted in laboratory.
    ### **Why should you buy me a coffee, i.e. donate ?**
    This app uses the ChatGPT AI model through the official API of OpenAI which has a cost. Also, this app is free to use and will 
    remain free to use for all if you support it by buying me a coffee (see the dedicated button and QR code on the left side).
