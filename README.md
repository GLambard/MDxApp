# :hospital: Welcome to the MDxApp page :hospital:

Here, we want to make the access to a large knowledge in 
medical diagnosis available to an as broad as possible community of 
medical professionals.  

For this, we have developed the **MDxApp** that's using **ChatGPT** 
(a chatbot recently developed by Open AI) as a proxy to assist you in proposing 
a quick diagnostic according to a patient's demographics, a recent environmental context, 
a list of symptoms, recent and relevant observations on the patient's state, and any existing 
chronic condition(s) followed by indications on any existing treatment(s). 

Patient's demographics, context, symptoms, observations, chronic conditions added to any relevant information 
can all be entered in plain text in the app. The medical jargon with known abbreviations is fully surported. 
More information on a patient may help to propose a more precise medical diagnostic. 

The use of the app is straightforward with examples shown to the user for guidance. 

The time response of the app may vary with the traffic of requests, the speed of your internet connection, and 
finally the disponibility of the Open AI API. If this happens, try again later. 

For nay requests, comments, questions on the app, please use the email form accessible from the contact page in the 
app. 

And last, but not the least, we would appreciate that, if you find this app useful, you share it around you by any 
channel you may prefer. 

Finally, support the further developments and maintenances of this app by buying me a coffee just below. I will deeply 
appreciate it 'cause I love coffee!
